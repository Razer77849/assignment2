This project provides a complete Java implementation of core data structures without relying on Java's built-in collections (except Iterator). It features two foundational list types - MyArrayList (dynamic array) and MyLinkedList (doubly-linked list) - which serve as building blocks for three higher-level structures: MyStack (array-based for O(1) push/pop), MyQueue (linked-list-based for O(1) enqueue/dequeue), and MyMinHeap (array-based binary heap with O(log n) operations). All implementations support iteration, bounds checking, and array conversion, with sorting capability for comparable elements. The architecture demonstrates thoughtful design choices by matching each logical structure with its optimal physical implementation: arrays for random access needs (stack, heap) and linked nodes for frequent head/tail operations (queue). While production-ready in functionality (including comprehensive test coverage), the project maintains academic transparency by acknowledging current limitations: basic bubble sort implementation, non-thread-safe design, and fixed initial capacity for array expansion. Ideal for educational purposes to understand data structure internals, the codebase also serves as a customizable foundation for specialized applications, with clear extension points for performance optimization (e.g., implementing quicksort) or additional features (like thread safety). The clean, documented implementation balances algorithmic efficiency (maintaining each structure's key time complexities) with readability, making it equally valuable for learning and practical integration.
